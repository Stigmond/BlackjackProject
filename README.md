## Blackjack Project

### Overview

This is the Week 4 assignment for the Skill Distillery Java Bootcamp.  This assignment is a Blackjack simulator that allows for both user and object interaction in a functioning game.

### How to Run

1.  This program will require the use of multiple files to ensure performance.  Please verify that all files, including abstracts, have been downloaded.

2.  Compile and/or run this Project in a compatible IDE or Java Runtime Environment of your choice.  This Project was programmed and compiled in Eclipse under Java SE 8 [1.8.0_261].

3.  Upon loading, this Program will offer a greeting and prompt user for a number of decks in the simulated Blackjack shoe.  User will be able to choose between 1-3 decks, as is the common size range in many casinos.

4.  After selecting the shoe, the game will begin immediately.  The rules of the game follow general BlackJack rules, allowing for User to review their hand versus the partially-revealed hand of the Dealer, and reacting accordingly.  User may choose to Hit or Stay, with the former being offered repeatedly until User stays or busts.  Dealer will then take a turn, and the results of the game will be announced upon Dealer's completion.

5. Once a winner has been declared, User will be given an option to play again.  If User chooses "Yes", play begins again from the same shoe.  If User chooses "No", the program will cease.

6.  Please note that the shoe will never fully deplete, but will be refilled periodically.

7.  No betting is implemented (in this version), so just have fun!

### Topics

Instead of any new topics, this project is a culmination of all topics previously listed in the first three projects. However, more emphasis was placed on:

* UML Design
* extending
* inter-Object communication
* logic.

### Lesson(s) Learned

* This project proved the absolute necessity of preparing thorough UML layouts prior to writing any code, as the alternative can lead to redundant code, frequent rewriting, and substantial time loss.
* This project showed the importance of knowing the use of the dot (".") operator as multiple methods in a class would have to be used, with some classes instantiated more than once.
